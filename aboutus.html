  <p class="head">About Us</p>
  <p class="body-about">Hello everyone, this is Team picKlean and we are international freshman students at San Francisco State University all majoring in the field of Computer Science. United by a shared vision of improving their new home city, the team is dedicated to addressing one of San Francisco's pressing issuesâ€”its cleanliness. To this end, we are developing a website aimed at mobilising community involvement in keeping the city clean and green.

    The essence of the picKlean initiative is to create a platform where residents can actively participate in cleaning efforts. The website allows users to photograph areas of the city that are littered or dirty and upload these images. This not only highlights the problem spots but also encourages community action to address them. Additionally, the platform offers an option for users to sign up as volunteers, committing their time and efforts to physically clean these areas.
    
    At its core, picKlean's mission is to foster a sense of responsibility and community engagement among San Francisco's residents, with the ultimate goal of maintaining the city's cleanliness and enhancing its livability for all. Through this innovative approach, Team picKlean hopes to inspire positive change and contribute significantly to the environmental well-being of San Francisco.</p>
